BATCH 2 OCR FIXES APPLIED
================================================================================

Total pages corrected: 7 pages (all pages in document)
Total fixes applied: Multiple corrections per page

Categories of fixes:
1. Extra leading digits in generation markers
   - Pattern: XXN-- → N-- (e.g., 936-- → 6--, 977-- → 7--, 612-- → 12--)
   - Fixed: ~30+ instances across all pages

2. Leading zero patterns
   - Pattern: 0NN-- → NN-- (e.g., 017-- → 7--, 027-- → 7--)
   - Fixed: ~10+ instances

3. Generation marker character errors
   - )L-- → )11-- (uppercase L after closing paren)
   - T-~ → 7-- (T and tilde)

4. Tilde characters in names/IDs
   - All ~ replaced with - throughout document
   - Affected: RICKEL~573, MOORE~576, SPRAGUE~413, POTTS~1361, etc.

5. Name OCR errors (character substitutions)
   - BRADFORO → BRADFORD
   - Rachel → Rachel (] → l)
   - Hichael → Michael
   - NOORE → MOORE
   - BLOON → BLOOM
   - Hariam → Miriam
   - Thonas → Thomas
   - NEWCOHB → NEWCOMB
   - BL1$S → BLISS
   - Siby] → Sibyl
   - LYNN%6 → LYNN
   - Hatthew → Matthew
   - Canmie → Cammie
   - Hary VAN → Mary VAN
   - £. → E.

6. Punctuation in names
   - "J, BOCKMEYER" → "J. BOCKMEYER" (comma to period)

7. Percentage signs in IDs
   - -139%6 → -1396


PAGE-BY-PAGE ACCURACY
================================================================================

Page 0: 31/50 linked (62.0%), 19 orphans (38.0%)
Page 1: 26/50 linked (52.0%), 24 orphans (48.0%)
Page 2: 47/51 linked (92.2%), 4 orphans (7.8%)
Page 3: 23/43 linked (53.5%), 20 orphans (46.5%)
Page 4: 23/42 linked (54.8%), 19 orphans (45.2%)
Page 5: 31/50 linked (62.0%), 19 orphans (38.0%)
Page 6: 20/20 linked (100.0%), 0 orphans (0.0%)

High-performing pages: 2 (92.2%), 6 (100%)
Problem pages: 1, 3, 4 (all <55%)


ORPHANS BY GENERATION
================================================================================

Gen 2: 2 orphans
Gen 3: 2 orphans
Gen 4: 4 orphans
Gen 5: 4 orphans
Gen 6: 1 orphan
Gen 7: 26 orphans
Gen 8: 9 orphans
Gen 9: 6 orphans
Gen 10: 10 orphans
Gen 11: 16 orphans
Gen 12: 25 orphans

TOTAL: 105 orphans (Gen 2-12)

Note: Most orphans are in higher generations (7, 11, 12), suggesting
potential issues with:
- High generation number OCR errors
- Complex family structures in later generations
- Missing or malformed generation markers


ANDREW NEWCOMB Lt. VERIFICATION
================================================================================

Person ID: 1
Status: [OK] 100% accuracy (15/15 children)

Family 1 (sp: Sarah): 7 children
Family 46 (sp: Anna BAYES): 8 children

All expected children successfully linked:
- First wife Sarah: 7 children ✓
- Second wife Anna BAYES: 8 children ✓


NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

1. Review problematic_lines_v2.csv (105 remaining orphans)
   - Focus on pages 1, 3, 4 (highest orphan rates)
   - Pay special attention to Gen 7, 11, 12 (highest orphan counts)

2. Manually compare OCR text with original PDF for:
   - Generation markers that may be misread
   - Name variations that don't match expected patterns
   - Inline records that may not be splitting correctly

3. Consider implementing:
   - Fuzzy matching for generation markers
   - Better handling of complex family structures
   - Enhanced spouse linking logic

4. Continue iterative OCR correction process
